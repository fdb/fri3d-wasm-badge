# Input System

The runtime provides a small, consistent input model across emulator, web, and firmware.

## Keys

- `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `ok`, `back`

## Event types

Events are delivered to app `on_input(key, type)` callbacks using the SDK enums in `src/sdk/input.h`:

- `input_type_press` — key down
- `input_type_release` — key up
- `input_type_short_press` — key held for < 300ms (synthesized)
- `input_type_long_press` — key held for >= 500ms (synthesized)

Short/long press events are generated by the runtime input manager and are available to apps on all platforms. These are not hard-coded to any specific app behavior; apps can interpret them as needed (e.g., long-press up/down for fast menu scrolling).

## Standard combos

- **Soft reset**: `left + back` held for 500ms
  - This is handled by the host and always returns to the launcher app.

## Recommended conventions

- Back short-press exits to the launcher in most apps (via `exit_to_launcher()` from `src/sdk/app.h`).
- Back long-press can be used to exit in apps that already bind short-press back to another action (e.g., zoom-out).

## Notes

- There is no repeat event emitted by the runtime today.
- Apps should handle both press/release and short/long press where appropriate.
